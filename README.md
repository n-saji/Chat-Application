# 🗨️ C++ Chat Application

A terminal-based real-time chat application developed in **C++** using **WebSockets** and socket programming. This project demonstrates client-server communication where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time messaging between multiple clients
- Socket-based communication using C++ standard libraries
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)
- Supports user join/leave notifications
- Efficient message broadcasting by server
- Clean separation between client and server logic

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- TCP Sockets
- WebSockets (optional integration if applicable)
- Multithreading (for handling multiple clients concurrently)
